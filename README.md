# RimPocalypse

Reimagining RimWorld style play with a focus on automation and systems building.

Check out the latest published [web version](https://cosmic-canopy-studio.github.io/rimpocalypse/) hosted on GitHub Pages to try out the latest published version.
> [!CAUTION]
> Web version currenly only works in Chrome. Or at least, not in Firefox.

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/cosmic-canopy-studio/rimpocalypse/wiki) to follow our process and progress as we
build out the game. We are keeping a [devlog](https://github.com/cosmic-canopy-studio/rimpocalypse/wiki/Minimum-Verifiable-Fun-(MVF)) of incremental implementation of 
features for those who want to see how the game evolves over time (which is often drastic, as this is our first Godot project).
